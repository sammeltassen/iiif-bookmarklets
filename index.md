This site contains a series of bookmarklets to work with IIIF content. You can install a bookmarklet by dragging the corresponding button to your favorites bar, or copying one of the scripts and pasting it in the address or URL field of a new bookmark. All bookmarklets have been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Bookmarkets are bookmarks that (after clicking) run javascript in your browser to interact with the current webpage. To clarify the workings of each script, the source code is provided with comments. For longer scripts, a minimized version is used to construct the link.
